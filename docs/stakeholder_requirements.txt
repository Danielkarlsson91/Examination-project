// Stakeholder requirements for the server

*Server Requirements

REQ-001: Server Status Indication

- The server must include an LED to display its current status
- The LED shall be usable for debugging purposes during development
- LED status should clearly communicate system state (e.g., connected, idle, error)

REQ-002: Communication Infrastructure
- The server must establish communication with the client via serial connection
- Support standard baud rates with configurable communication parameters
- Ensure robust and reliable data transmission

REQ-003: Session Management

- Implement a secure session management system
- Allow only one active session at a time
- Automatically terminate sessions after a predefined period of inactivity
- Provide mechanisms for session establishment and termination

REQ-004: Communication Security
- Secure all communication between client and server
- Implement protection against unauthorized access
- Use modern cryptographic methods to ensure:

- Data integrity
- Data confidentiality
- Secure key exchange
- Protect against potential security vulnerabilities

* Client Requirements
REQ-001: Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Develop a user-friendly graphical interface using PyQt6
- Provide intuitive controls for system interaction
- Ensure responsive and clear user experience

REQ-002: User Interaction Capabilities
- Enable users to:
- Establish and terminate server connections
- Retrieve system information (e.g., temperature)
- Control system functions (e.g., relay toggling)
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions

REQ-003: Information Access
- Allow retrieval of:
- System temperature
- Relay state
- Session status
- Present information clearly and accurately

REQ-004: Logging and Transparency
- Implement comprehensive logging system
- Record:

System events
User actions
Communication status


Provide a clear log interface for user review

REQ-005: Security Compliance

Implement all client-side security measures
Use identical cryptographic protocols as the server
Ensure end-to-end encrypted communication
Protect user data and system integrity

Additional Considerations

Platform Compatibility

Develop for Linux environment
Ensure consistent performance across different systems


Performance Requirements

Minimize communication latency
Optimize resource utilization
Provide quick response times for user interactions


Error Handling

Implement robust error detection mechanisms
Provide clear, user-friendly error messages
Develop graceful error recovery processes
